📋 Manufacturer-Specific IVR Forms

🔹 System Handling

The system maintains a mapping between:
Brand → Manufacturer → IVR Form Template
Brand Name

🧠 Developer Implementation Notes
Build an IVR Form Mapping Table (Brand → Form Template → Format/URL)
Create an IVR Entry Form for Admins to log status, upload response files
Tie each IVR entry to: Patient + Clinic + Brand + Manufacturer
Use IVR status as a condition for enabling the "Submit Order" button on the ordering form
All uploaded files should be securely stored and accessible only by Admins and the owning clinic
