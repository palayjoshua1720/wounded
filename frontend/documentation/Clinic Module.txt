📋 Core Features & Workflows

1. 📦 Place Graft Orders
Clinics can submit an order through the portal. Orders are routed internally to the correct manufacturer (based on brand).
Order Form Fields:
Patient Name
Date of Service
Select Graft Brand (dropdown; no manufacturer shown)
Add Graft Sizes + Quantity
Optional Notes
Rules:
The patient must be marked as eligible based on IVR submission before allowing order submission.
Brands are mapped to manufacturers in the backend only.
Backend Logic:
System sends the order to the right manufacturer based on brand selection.
Email or API submission may include smart links for manufacturers to update status (e.g., Acknowledge, Ship, Deliver).

2. 🔍 View & Track Orders
Clinics can view their full order history, including:
Field
Description
Order ID
Unique reference
Patient
Who it was intended for
Brand
Selected during ordering
Sizes & Quantities
2x2 (4), 4x4 (2), etc.
Status
Submitted → Acknowledged → Shipped → Delivered
Serial Numbers
Shown after delivery
Eligibility Verified
Yes/No
Notes
Additional order notes


3. 📝 Upload Graft Usage Logs
Once grafts are delivered and assigned serials, clinics log how each graft was used.
Log Fields:
Serial Number (from delivered items)
Actual Patient Name
Date of Service
Wound Site (e.g., Left Heel)
Clinician Name
Notes (e.g., reused, partial use)
Logic:
One serial can be logged multiple times (e.g., reused)
Actual patient can differ from “intended” patient in the order
A patient can have multiple wounds and usage logs

4. 💳 Invoices & Payment Tracking
Clinics can view invoices associated with their delivered grafts.
Fields Visible to Clinics:
Invoice Number
Date
Associated Serials
Invoice Amount
Payment Status (Paid, Unpaid, Partial)
Balance Due
Payment Date (if paid)
Logic:
One invoice can include multiple serials
Serial payment status may be matched via Google Sheet or uploaded receipt
Clinics cannot modify invoice data; view-only

5. 📊 Reports & Summaries
Clinics can generate reports from filters like:
Filter Options
Patient Name
Date Range
Graft Brand
Graft Size
Invoice Status
Serial Status (Used/Unused)

Example Reports:
Total grafts used by Patient X in May
All unpaid invoices from June
All delivered but unused serials
Grafts used across multiple wounds for Patient Y

6. 🔔 Notifications
The system sends clinic users email and/or in-system alerts for:
Order status updates
Serial numbers available after delivery
Reminder to log usage after delivery
New invoice uploaded
Overdue unpaid invoices
Rejected IVR results

🧠 Developer Notes
Create dynamic order form that shows/hides based on IVR eligibility
Serial tracking per order line item (based on size & quantity)
Graft usage logs must support one-to-many relation (1 serial: multiple wounds/patients)
Clinic access must filter all data by their clinic ID
Use dropdowns for standard inputs: brand, size, wound site
All invoices should be auto-linked to serials for accurate payment tracking
